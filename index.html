                <h2 id="whatisit">What is a mechanical keyboard?</h2>
                <p>Mechanical keyboards are the keyboards that most people picture when they think about keyboards; they're the classic-looking, sturdy keyboards from the 1980s. A more proper definition is that mechanical keyboards are made with high-quality plastic key switches underneath each of the keycaps.</p>
                <p>These keyboard switches are comprised of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keycap: the top cap with the letter/number</li>
                    <li>Stem: the part underneath the keycap that moves down when pressed</li>
                    <li>Housing: the case holding together all the components</li>
                </ul>

                <img src="img/keyboard-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded">

                <p>Typing on a mechanical keyboard means pressing down on a keycap, which activates an actual physical switch underneath that's spring-loaded. So when you press the key, you feel it and you'll hear a “clicking” sound to let you know that you've pressed the key hard enough to register (and that you haven't missed a letter or number).</p>
                
                <h3>Linear vs tactile</h3>
                <p>Most mechanical keyboard switches are either linear or tactile. Linear switches need to be pushed all the way down, while tactile switches only need to be pushed about halfway down to activate, so you can move to the next key more quickly and easily.</p>

                <h3>Cherry MX switches</h3>
                <p>In the early 1980s, a company called Cherry used to exclusively develop and manufacture plastic key switches called <a href="https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX" target="_blank">Cherry MX switches</a>, which are often referenced by key stem colour. Now there are several PC keyboard manufacturers who are developing these switches, including Razer, Logitech, Corsair, and others.</p>
                <p>Each switch varies depending on several characteristics, including the auditory and tactile nature of the switch, the amount of force needed to actuate it, and the keyboard's application or user preference.</p>
                <p>Here is a table of the most common Cherry MX Switches: </p>

                <h2 id="customizing">Customizing keyboards</h2>
                <p>Besides replacing switches, you can customize mechanical keyboards in other ways. There are specialized gaming keypads that offer anywhere from 10 to 20 programmable keys. These provide similar customization and ergonomic designs found in other peripherals such as gaming mice and apply them to keyboard gaming functions.</p>
                <p>You can also get backlit keycaps that allow LED light to pass through the keycap.</p>
                <p>Another option is replacing keycaps with certain materials, such as durable plastics or moulded sculpting, so that lettering is less likely to wear away. Others want to make their keyboard ultra-personalized by customizing keycaps with specific designs, colours, names, shapes, or logos.</p>

                <h2 id="choosingone">Choosing the right mechanical gaming keyboard</h2>
                <p>Choosing the right mechanical keyboard for your gaming needs is a personal experience. Most gamers prefer mechanical keyboards because they're more tactile, durable, and faster. At the same time, some gamers appreciate the smaller footprint, portability, and lower price points of the membrane keyboards. Still, others want the best of both in a hybrid.</p>
                <p>Here are a few characteristics to think about when selecting your mechanical keyboard.</p>

                <h3>Actuation force</h3>
                <p>Actuation force is the force required to press the key on the keyboard. It's the key travel distance where the key is recognized by the keyboard. In other words, it measures how hard you need to press the key so that it's recognized by the keyboard.</p>
                <p>Actuation force varies widely and can range from 35 grams to as high as 350 grams. Most mechanical keyboards range from 45 to 60 grams.</p>

                <h3>Actuation distance</h3>
                <p>The actuation distance is the distance which the switch needs to depress to register as an input. It's measured from the top of the keycap. An average rating for most mechanical keyboards is 2 mm, though there are some as low as 1 mm.</p>
                <p>Shorter actuation distance doesn't automatically make you a better gamer; you may make more keyboard mistakes, for instance, because of the lighter feel.</p>

                <h3>Tactility</h3>
                <p>Tactility refers to the feedback and resistance that you receive when typing. It's associated with the position that the key travels to when generating a keystroke. The feedback can be audible through a clicking sound, for instance, as well as visual in that you're watching your fingers press the keys, which spring back and raise the keycap.</p>
                <p>Mechanical keyboards tend to be more tactile. Conversely, many membrane keyboards are not tactile and feel somewhat softened after normal wear and tear thanks to their design. While membrane keyboards can be engineered to provide some tactility, they usually lack the more durable feel of the keys in mechanical keyboards or even scissor-switch keyboards.</p>

                <h3>Noise level</h3>
                <p>Noise and sound levels on keyboards can be important depending on the type of application you're using or the game that you're playing, and where you're playing it. Mechanical keyboards, for instance, are noisier than any other type of keyboard because there are clicks at both the beginning and end of keystrokes.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, membrane keyboards have the quietest switches because they have rubber or silicone cushioning that mechanical keyboards lack for the most part. Scissor-switch membrane switches are noisier than regular membrane switches since they have less rubber cushioning.</p>

                <h3>Durability/lifespan</h3>
                <p>Measuring durability takes into account things like how many keystrokes a particular mechanical keyboard is rated for over its lifespan. Consider that an average keystroke per hour (KPH) is approximately 8,000 KPH, and then multiply this by the number of hours that gamers tend to play over the course of just a few weeks, and you can see how exponentially those numbers increase.</p>
                <p>The best mechanical keyboards are much more durable than membrane or rubber dome keyboards. For example, Cherry MX switches are rated to a lifespan of 20 to 50 million keystrokes, depending on the type of switch.</p>

                <h3>Cost</h3>
                <p>Mechanical keyboards range from as low as $60 or so to upwards of $300. And if you're ok with an older model, you'll pay even less. There are also pricing differentials between well-known and generic brands, as well as between full-size keyboards, with and without RGB lighting.</p>
